# Task 5: Wireshark Network Traffic Capture and Analysis

## 📋 Description
Captured live network traffic using Wireshark to analyze real-time packet flows. This task focused on identifying common internet and local network protocols through filtering and inspection of captured data. It provided hands-on experience with packet analysis and network troubleshooting.

## 📡 Protocols Observed
- **TLSv1.2** – Secure web communication (HTTPS)
- **TCP** – Reliable, connection-oriented protocol
- **UDP** – Lightweight, connectionless protocol used by services like DNS and video streaming
- **NBNS** – NetBIOS Name Service for resolving device names on local networks
- **ICMP** – Used for network diagnostics (e.g., unreachable messages)
- **DHCP** – Assigns IP addresses to devices
- **ARP** – Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses

## 🧪 What Was Done
- Installed and launched Wireshark  
- Selected active Wi-Fi interface to capture packets  
- Visited websites and ran ping commands to generate traffic  
- Used protocol filters (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`, `tls`) for analysis  
- Identified and documented multiple protocol types  
- Saved capture as `.pcapng` file and summarized findings  

## 📁 Files Included
- `network-capture.pcapng` – Packet capture file  
- `README.md` – This summary report  

## ✅ Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with Wireshark  
- Strengthened understanding of internet protocol behavior  
- Practiced network troubleshooting and traffic inspection
